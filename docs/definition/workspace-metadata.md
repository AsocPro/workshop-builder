# Workspace Metadata — DISSOLVED

The fields previously documented here (`lifecycle`, `isolation`, `cluster`, `resources`, `access`) are no longer a workshop author concern. They have moved to the [WorkspaceTemplate CRD](../platform/crds.md), where operators configure them directly.

There is no `workspace.yaml` file. Authors write [`workshop.yaml`](./workshop.md) only.
