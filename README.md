Toolkit for creating student environments for workshops

The goal of this project is to make it easy to spin up environments for use in workshops at conferences or other similar environments. 

This project spawned from a number of great workshops that were essentially cut short because there was so much overhead in getting the student environments created and dealing with different connectivity issues. 

## Current Features
 - This readme right here is currently the only functional part of this project. 

## Planned features
 - Easily provide student environments where all of the necessary tools are pre-installed; no wasted time on creating accounts, compiling or installing extra packages.  They just log in and go.
 - Student web interface with main workshop outline.
 - Integrated progress tracking based on environment state or files etc.
 - Shell based guidance system to walk the student through the outline without the need to be going back to the web interface. This can also provide helpers to be able to nudge students in the correct direction if needed. 
 - Auto advance button that will automatically perform the current needed step if needed to catch up with the class. 
 - Easy deployment script for students to be able to retry the workshop after the fact in case they want to revisit it. 
 - State management/download. Be able to download state and resume later/after the workshop in your own environment. 
 - Instructor interface with global tracking all students to be able to know if people are keeping up.
